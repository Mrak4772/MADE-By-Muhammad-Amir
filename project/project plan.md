TitleUnderstanding and Predicting Climate Change Metrics

Main Question
How can we understand and predict the impact of climate
change metrics, specifically CO2 levels and temperatures, over time?

Description
This involves analyzing historical climate data to identify trends and using machine learning models
to predict future changes in CO2 concentrations and temperature averages.

Datasources
The data sources for this project were chosen based on their comprehensive coverage of
climate-related metrics and their credibility. The datasets used include:
- Global Land Temperatures by City: Provides historical temperature data for various cities around
the world.
- Temperatures by Country: Contains historical temperature data aggregated by country.
- Temperatures by Major City: Focuses on temperature data for major global cities.
- Temperatures by State: Includes temperature records for states within countries.
- Global Temperatures: A global dataset for temperature records.
These datasets are sourced from Kaggle's climate change datasets and contain various climate
metrics such as average temperature, CO2 levels, and timestamps. Each dataset was chosen for its
relevance and the granularity of the data it provides, which is essential for detailed analysis and
prediction.
